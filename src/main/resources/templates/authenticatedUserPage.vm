<h1>Authenticated User Page</h1>

<p>The current time is ${time}.</p>

<p>This page is only available to <em>logged in</em> users.</p>

<p>In Spring Security's default implementation and configuration it is equivalent to say
    the current user must not be anonymous. The authenticateion "level" - i.e.,
    authentication by "remember me" feature, entry of username and password, or
    even multi-factor authentication - does not matter.</p>
